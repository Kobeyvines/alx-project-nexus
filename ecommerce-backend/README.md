# 🌐 ALX Project Nexus

This repository showcases my journey through the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program, with a focus on building a production-ready e-commerce backend.
It documents my learnings, challenges, and best practices applied while designing and implementing the system.
---

## 📖 Program Overview
The E-Commerce Backend project simulates a real-world online store.
Users can browse products, manage carts, place orders, and track order history. Admins can manage products, categories, and user roles.

Key focus areas included:

Backend APIs using Django REST Framework

Database modeling for products, carts, orders, and users

Security & Authentication with JWT and role-based access

Deployment using Docker and CI/CD pipelines
---

## 🔑 Key Learnings

### 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python** → Core backend logic and scripting
- **Django** → Building scalable web applications
- **REST APIs** → Designing clean, maintainable endpoints
- **GraphQL** → Flexible queries for client needs
- **Docker** → Containerization for reproducibility
- **CI/CD** → Automation with tools like GitHub Actions / Jenkins

---

### 📚 Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design** → ERDs, normalization (3NF), relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:N)  
- **Asynchronous Programming** → Handling concurrency with async views, Celery workers  
- **Caching Strategies** → Using Redis & caching middleware for performance  
- **Authentication & Security** → JWT, OAuth2, role-based access control  
- **Testing** → Unit tests, integration tests, CI pipelines

---

### ⚡ Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Debugging Docker container networking  
  - *Solution:* Learned volume mounts, networking bridges, and Docker Compose.  
- **Challenge:** Preventing modification of checked-out carts  
  - *Solution:* Added validation in perform_update and perform_destroy methods in the CartItemViewSet.
- **Challenge:** CI/CD deployment failures  
  - *Solution:* Broke pipelines into stages (build → test → deploy) and added logging.

---

### 🏆 Best Practices & Takeaways
- Always **write clean, modular code** (PEP8, DRY, SOLID principles).  
- **Document APIs early** with Swagger/OpenAPI.  
- Use **environment variables** for secrets (12-factor app principles).  
- Build **tests alongside features** → prevents regressions.  
- Think **scalability and maintainability** from day one.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Apply these learnings in real-world projects (e.g., Bookclub App, Airbnb Clone).  
- Explore advanced topics like microservices, event-driven systems, and AI-powered backends.
